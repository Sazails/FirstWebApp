# FirstWebApp
My first web application done with "apache-tomcat-9.0.30" and "MySQL. I created this project to try out and learn how I can work with a database in terms of storing, getting data and setting up MySQL "userData" table.

### What needs to be done
-Check if user input is not already in the database and or over the character limit, if it is then send to an error page.
-Main page for created users.
-Clean up the code by seperating code into their own methods/classes (such as a class for methods to work with loading and saving data with SQL).<br>
