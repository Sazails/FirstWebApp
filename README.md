# FirstWebApp
My first web application done with "apache-tomcat-9.0.30" and "MySQL. I created this project to try out and learn how I can work with a database in terms of storing, getting data and setting up MySQL "userData" table.

## What needs to be done
-Add the ability to check if the input is correct and is already not on the database (such as usernames).<br>
-Create a class that holds functions to do with the SQL database (such as saving and loading data).<br>
-Overall seperate functions into their own methods/classes to prevent messy code.
